PROJECT 1:FINANCE AND ECONOMIC DATA ANALYSIS
 OVERVIEW 

   This project explores financial and economic data with the aim of identifying key trends, relationships, and predictive insights.
It combines Python (data cleaning, analysis, visualization) and Tableau (dashboarding) to provide both technical depth and accessible insights.

 BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

STAKEHOLDERS
Policymakers, financial analysts, and business leaders interested in economic indicators.

Key Business Questions

How has GDP growth trended over time?
What relationships exist between GDP, inflation, and unemployment?
Can simple predictive models provide insights into GDP performance?
How can visual dashboards help stakeholders make decisions quickly?

DATA UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS

Source of Data
Dataset downloaded from Kaggle: Finance & Economic Dataset.
Description of Data

The dataset contains economic and financial indicators over time, including:
GDP Growth (%)
Inflation Rate (%)
Unemployment Rate (%)
Interest Rate (%)
Consumer Confidence Index
Stock Market Data
Forex, Gold, and Oil Prices
Corporate Profits & Government Debt

KEY STEPS 

Data cleaning and handling missing values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation analysis
Regression modeling (predicting GDP using inflation & unemployment)
Visualization in Python and Tableau

VISUALIZATIONS

1. GDP Growth Over Time
Line chart showing GDP growth trends by date.
2. Correlation Heatmap
Heatmap of numerical features, highlighting relationships between GDP, inflation, and unemployment.
3. Scatter Plot (GDP vs Inflation/Unemployment)
Shows NEGATIVE relationship between inflation/unemployment and GDP.
 These visualizations were presented in Tableau

CONCLUSION

Summary of Findings
GDP Growth Trend: Clear fluctuations with periods of growth and decline.
Correlations: Strong negative relationship between GDP growth and unemployment; moderate link with inflation.
Predictive Insights: A simple regression model gives a starting point but more advanced time-series forecasting is needed for accuracy.

LIMITATIONS

Dataset is relatively small.
Only linear regression applied (basic).
External shocks (e.g., global events) not modeled.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Use time series models like ARIMA or Prophet.
Incorporate more financial indicators (stock indices, interest rates).
Deploy dashboards for real-time monitoring.

COMMIT HISTORY
